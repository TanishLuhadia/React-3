This project is a React-based application designed to manage and display student placement details. It showcases the use of React components, refs, and state management to build a functional UI for filtering and displaying student data.

 Components

- Student Class
  - A JavaScript class that models a student with properties such as `id`, `name`, `company`, and `salary`. It includes methods to retrieve these properties.

- AppExample5 Component
  - A functional React component that serves as the main application interface. It uses `useRef` to interact with child components and manages the state of students and the selected student. It handles filtering students based on company and updates the detail view upon selection.

- PlacementList Component
  - A class-based React component that displays a list of students for a specific placement year. It receives a callback function to handle student selection and updates the list based on the filter criteria.

- PlacementDetail Component
  - A class-based React component that shows detailed information about the selected student. It updates its display based on the student data passed from the parent component.

 Key Concepts

- State Management: Uses React's `useRef` to manage and pass state between components.
- Dynamic Updates: Real-time updates of the student list and details based on user interactions.
- Component Communication: Utilizes props and refs to handle data flow and interactions between components.

 Purpose

The application demonstrates fundamental React concepts such as component-based architecture, state management, and user interaction handling. It provides a practical example of how to create an interactive UI with filtering and detail display features.
